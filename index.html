        <h1>What is rovercode?</h1>
        <h2>Business Objective</h2>
        <p>
            rovercode seeks to provide all teachers with an affordable, zero-fuss student robotics system that allows their students
            to be coding within minutes.
        </p>
        <h2>Core Principals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Open source benefits everyone.</strong> Everyone is welcome to use and improve all of rovercode's hardware
                and software.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Students should hit the ground coding.</strong> While many educational robotics platforms emphasize construction,
                rovercode will provide a ready-to-code-out-of-the-box product. At the same time, rovercode's open-source
                nature means there will be no limit or black boxes for any student interested in building a rover from scratch.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>All students can learn to code.</strong> Coding doesn't take "a special kind of brain" to learn; rather,
                anyone can learn it with appropriate instruction and experiences.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Sponsorship Types</h1>

        <h2>Hosting Sponsor - $300</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            rovercode's web application for block-based programming is the heart of the student's experience. In addition, we provide
            a network for students to share and fork each others' code, as well as a hub for teachers to collaborate on rovercode-centered
            lesson plans. A hosting sponsor helps pay for the cloud services costs for hosting the servers and databases
            that make this possible.
        </p>

            The web application is great, but rovercode is nothing without a rover. We are constantly protyping new and better iterations
            of the rover hardware, and a Hardware Sponsor helps pay for the PCB fabrication costs for our custom motor and
            sensor board.
