# rovercode Sponsorship and Advertising Guidelines

## Hand-picked sponsorships, not open ad space
We should use the strategy of soliciting sponsorships from hand-picked companies. We should not use Google Ads.

## Advertising to students
The only sponsorship banners that should be within constant view of the students (in Mission Control or on the rover itself) should be technology brands that have the potential to excite and to inform students about technology. Any brand that doesn't 
meet this criteria should be restricted to areas more often visited by adult teachers and hobbyists -- the homepage, the GitHub page, and the docs.

For example, a "Powered by AWS" banner would be allowed (or event encouraged) to be in Mission Control. The banner "fueled by Mountain Dew", however, would not be allowed in Mission Control.
